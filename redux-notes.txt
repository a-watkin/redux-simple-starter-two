Application state is a plain JS object

Reducer

    a function that returns a piece of the application state

    an application can have many reducers



Container (sometimes called a smart component)

    a react component that has a direct link to the state managed by redux


    What should be a container?

        the highest level component that cares about a particular piece of state - data flows down fromt here, ask what the most senior component is that cares about that piece of state


Action creator:

    just a function that returns an action

    and an action is just an object that flows through the reducers which can use it's value to produce a different state


Component state is different from application state that is managed by redux
